#### Running Unprompted v$VERSION via the official Automatic1111 WebUI extension.

Unprompted is a powerful templating language written in Python. Unlike most templating languages, Unprompted was designed for **maximum readibility with natural language.** It is built around `[shortcodes]` and inspired by the likes of BBCode.
